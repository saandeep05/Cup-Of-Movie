## DESCRIPTION

### This is a content-based recommender system.

### It simply takes user's fav movie as input and recommend movies that might be of user's best interest.

### Implemented as a functional approach in jupyter notebook at first so that the data can be analyzed. Later it's implemented in object oriented approach so that the code can be reused using any dataset and the features that define the recommender system can be changed accordingly.

### Let the users know which movies are really their cup of tea!
